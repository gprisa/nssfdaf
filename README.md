# NSSF DAF

The NSSF DAF consists of a solution that runs in user equipment (e.g. smartphones, vehicles, IoT brokers) in the background and at the edge of the network operator or service provider. The framework has several modules that can be configured according to the context of applications, geographic location, scenarios of mobility, strategies of slices selection, among others. For energy saving, the user equipment only signals its consumption profile or user application preference to the framework host.
